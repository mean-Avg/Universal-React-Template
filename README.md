Sooooo...

You want to develop a React project

You want a redux store for good state management

You want an express server that the app runs on

You want this server to render page routes and a db connection

You also want server side rendering

You also want hot reloading

It should be fast

You want a linter, it will help

Webpack 4 is here

webpack-isomorphic-tools is used in legacy projects

This project provides a boilerplate for all the above

PS: redux-sagas

kind of overkill though, i think
